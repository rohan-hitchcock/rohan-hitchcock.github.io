My name is Rohan Hitchcock and I am currently completing a Masters in Mathematics 
and Statistics at 
the University of Melbourne. You can read my 
CV [here](cv.pdf).



# Masters thesis
I am currently completing a masters thesis on the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models
under the supervision of Dr Daniel Murfet.
This bicategory can be thought of as a bicategory in which the objects are polynomials with 
isolated singularities and the 1-morphisms between polynomials $$U(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$$
and $$V(y_1, \cdots, y_m)$$ are algebraic subsets of the zero set of $$U - V$$.

### Talks in the [Metauni Landau-Ginzburg Seminar](https://metauni.org/posts/events/seminar-lg)
- An introduction to bicategories ([notes](notes/bicategories.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6W_3tMz0qA)).
- Matrix factorisations and geometry ([notes](notes/matrix-factorisations-geometry.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa_kQs0PGKY)).
- The Perturbation Lemma ([notes](notes/pertubation-lemma.pdf), [video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gWUA5tCgc4), [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_jlHU0FuwA)).
- Composition in the bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models ([notes](notes/composition-in-LG.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZhsDkBHPmY)).
- The cut operation ([notes](notes/cut-operation.pdf), [video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbAYN4MsEVA), [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1c5HosIs_g)).
- Differentiation and division ([notes](notes/differentiation-and-division.pdf))

### Other notes
- Introduction to idempotent completion in preadditive categories ([notes](notes/idempotents.pdf)).
- Another introduction to matrix factorisations ([notes](notes/matrix-factorisations-ses.pdf)). 
This is an edited version of an assessment for a subject called 
*Communication for Research Scientists*, where the task was to write a short journal-style article.


# Deep learning and singular learning theory
I began my thesis looking at deep learning, algebraic geometry and singular 
learning theory, along the lines of the book *Algebraic Geometry and Statistical 
Learning Theory* (2009) by Sumio Watanabe.

- A short review of literature on singular learning theory ([notes](notes/slt-literature-review.pdf)).
- A non-technical blog-style article on deep learning and singular learning theory ([notes](notes/slt-blog-article.pdf)).
This was an assessment piece for a subject called *Communication for Research Scientists*.
- Notes from a talk on blow-ups and singular learning theory ([notes](notes/blowups.pdf)).
- A 'Stone-Weierstrass' Theorem for neural networks ([notes](notes/nn-approximation.pdf)).

In the January 2021 I completed the course 
[*The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning*](https://deeplearningmath.org)
as part of the [Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute Summer School](https://ss.amsi.org.au). 

- Final project ([notes](notes/amsi-ss-final-project-abstract.pdf), [video](https://youtu.be/UnyXhQRXOoU), [code](https://github.com/rohan-hitchcock/deep-learning-math-course)). This project was a review and demonstration of results in the paper "Wasserstein GAN" (2017)
by M. Arjovsky, S. Chintala, and L. Bottou [arXiv: 1701.07875 \[stat.ML\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875).


# Miscellaneous
- Paper: "Display of Native Antigen on cDC1 That Have Spatial Access to Both T and B Cells Underlies Efficient Humoral Vaccination" (2020)
by Kato et. al. [doi:10.4049/jimmunol.2000549](https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000549). 
My contribution to this paper consisted of writing simulations of biological processes 
to support experimental data, and rewriting legacy image processing code. 
This work was undertaken while I was a research assistant at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.
- From June 2018 to August 2020 I worked on a cross-disciplinary research project 
at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and The University of 
Melbourne ([code](https://github.com/rohan-hitchcock/tcells-portfolio)). 
The aim of this project wa to determine a stochastic model the motion for a certain population of immune 
cells residing in the liver. I worked with and was supervised by Dr Lynette Beattie (Dept. Microbiology and Immunology), 
Professor Jonathan Manton (Dept. Electrical and Electronic Engineering) 
and Professor William Heath (Dept. Microbiology and Immunology), all at The University of Melbourne.
- [AMSI Vacation Research Scholarship](https://vrs.amsi.org.au/student-profile/rohan-hitchcock/) ([report](notes/amsi-vrs-report.pdf)).
In the summer of 2019/2020 I completed a six week research project at the 
University of Western Australia under the supervision of Dr John Bamberg and Professor 
Michael Guidici. My project was centred around understanding the paper "Octonions, Albert Vectors 
and the group $$E_6(F)$$" (2019) by J. N. Bray, Y. Stepanov and R. A. Wilson 
[arXiv:1906.08846](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08846).
