My name is Rohan Hitchcock and I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University 
of Melbourne and [CSRIO](https://www.csiro.au). I am interested in understanding 
how deep learning works, with a view towards improving the interpretability 
and safety of large, complex and highly capable models. I see
*[singular learning theory](https://metauni.org/slt/)* and 
*[developmental interpretability](https://devinterp.com/)* as promising directions.
In my PhD I am 
thinking about the mathematical theory of singular learning theory and developmental 
interpretability (e.g. improving and better understanding local-learning coefficient estimation), 
and, in collaboration with CSIRO, applying these interpretability methods to neural networks trained 
to simulate physical systems.

Prior to my PhD I completed a Masters thesis in mathematics, in algebraic geometry and homological 
algebra at the University of Melbourne. My thesis investigated aspects of 
the *bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models*, a mathematical structure which 
describes relationships between different algebraic singularities. I focused on 
methods for explicitly computing these relationships (morphisms), as opposed to 
simply proving that such a relationship exists, and contributed algorithms for 
doing so. These algorithms led to the characterisation of a situation under which 
an important construction can be done more simply. 

I currently work as a tutor (teaching assistant) in the School of Mathematics and 
Statistics and the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of 
Melbourne, where I have taught
undergraduate classes on artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, 
linear algebra and vector calculus. You can see more about my teaching experience 
[here](teaching).
