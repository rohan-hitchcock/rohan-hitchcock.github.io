## Seminars
This is a list of seminars I have organised. These seminars were designed for 
first and second year mathematics students. My responsibilities included 
designing the seminars' curriculum, mentoring students preparing for their talks
and general seminar administration.

### Neural Networks (2021 Sem. 1)
Co-organised with Nora Ganter.

Topics:
- *Introduction:* What is machine learning? Logistic regression.
- *Defining neural networks:* What is a neural network? Explain the need 
for activation functions and state approximation results.
- *Training neural networks:* Discuss gradient descent and backpropagation. 
- *GANs part 1:* Discuss the standard GAN formulation.
- *GANs part 2:* Discuss the Wasserstein GAN, as introduced in Arjovsky, Chintala, Bottou, "Wasserstein GAN" [arXiv:1701.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875).
