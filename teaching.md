I am currently a tutor (teaching assistant) in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. I have taught 
undergraduate subjects on artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, 
linear algebra and vector calculus. 

In addition my regular duties as a tutor, I have also worked on a number of other 
teaching-related projects. I have developed subject content, including
video lectures, interactive programming modules, online mathematics quizzes, and 
exam and assignment questions. I have also worked on technical aspects of WebWork
(an online mathematics quiz system) and on the technical aspects of potential replacements.

## Undergraduate seminars
In 2020 and 2021 I organised three semester-long seminar series for first and second 
year undergraduate students. These were designed to expose early undergraduate students 
to the experience of researching and presenting on relatively advanced topics. 
These were co-organised with Nora Ganter and, in various iterations, with the 
assistance of Majid Alamudi, Jonah Nelson, Kshitija Vaidya, Adam Walsh, Chengjing Zhang, and Gufang Zhao. The theme of each series was:
- Neural networks (2021 Sem. 1)
- Game theory (2020 Sem. 2)
- Cryptography (2020 Sem. 1)
